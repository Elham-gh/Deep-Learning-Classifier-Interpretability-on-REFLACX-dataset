*************************************************

In incorrectly predicted classes; 
Only 2 classes (1 and 8) were incorrectly predicted and had a non-zero NCC with another heatmap, the rest NCCs are zero 
	 Saliency of the wrong class 1 has the highest NCC=.58 with gaze heatmaps of class 3 
	 Saliency of the wrong class 8 has the highest NCC=.32 with gaze heatmaps of class 0 
*************************************************

In Correctly predicted classes; 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 0=0.000000 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 1=0.067438 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 2=0.143551 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 3=0.034757 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 4=0.000000 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 5=0.000000 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 6=0.000000 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 7=0.000000 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 8=0.319823 
Mean NCC between saliency and heatmap class 9=0.000000
